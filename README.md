# Scipy-and-Scikit-Learn

The purpose of this assignment is to practice data analysis using the python modules scipy and scikit learn.

inputs: x_data (that's a 2d array extracted from the dataset),  y_data (contains the labels fpr each iris species), sepal_length and sepal_width that's extracted from the iris dataset, x_train, y_train, x_test, and y_test( all used to  train the models)

outputs: Using these inputs, the output should return the classification models and the metrics used to compare the data

Library: Scipy(to perform interpolation), Scikit learn (to load dataset and perform model selection metrics), and Numpy(to calculate sum absolute difference in the program)
